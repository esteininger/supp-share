### [SuppShare.com](https://SuppShare.com) is a free open source web app that lets you:
  1. Sign in via Facebook
  2. Input your goals (e.g. weight loss, cognitive improvement, muscle gain, etc.)
  3. Search for supplements that you take to meet these goals and write up why you take them
  4. Share your public profile link (e.g. suppshare.com/esteininger)
  5. Find what other people have similar goals as you and see what supps they take and why
  
#### What's the state of SuppShare?
I'm working on it as I have time! Would love some help building it ;)

#### How do I run SuppShare locally?
  1. Download this library
  2. Run `pip install flask` 
  3. Navigate to localhost:5007
  4. There is one file, `Utilities.py` missing, which includes Amazon keys and MongoDB connection info
